## Description

DonorHub is a donation management app designed specifically for organization managers to streamline the donation process. With DonorHub, nonprofits, charities, and fundraising organizations can efficiently track, manage, and analyze donations from Donors all in one centralized platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io)

## Create Database and User Table

Create a new database, then create a `user` table using the query found in `database.sql`.

* Note: `pool.js` is initially configured to connect to a database named `prime_app`. If you choose your own name, you'll need to modify `pool.js` so it knows how to connect to your database.

## Initial Setup Instructions

- In this repo's **root directory**, run `npm install`.
- Create an `.env` file in the **root directory**, then paste this line into the file:
    ```plaintext
      SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
    ```
- While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some a random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. 
    - Here's a site that can help you: [Password Generator Plus](https://passwordsgenerator.net).
    - If you skip this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you'll get a big warning message each time you start your server.
- Run `npm run server` to start the server.
- Run `npm run client` to start the client.
- Navigate to `localhost:5173`.
    - Verify that you are able to:
        - Register as a new user.
        - Log out.
        - Log back in.
        - Log out.
- Congrats! You now have a starting line for the cool thing you're about to build. ðŸ™‚
